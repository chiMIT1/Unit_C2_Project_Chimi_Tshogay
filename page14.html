      <p>Create an HTML Tutorial site</p>

      <p>Your objective is to create an HTML tutorial website:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This site must contain at least eight web pages, including the home page (index.html), and at least seven other pages (page2.html through page8.html).</li>
        <li>Each page must contain a lesson about writing HTML code, including showing what the code looks like, as well as the result of writing that code if visible on a web page.</li>
        <li>The home page should have a link to each page, as well as a “start here” link to go to page2, which should start the lessons.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Have fun. I hope you enjoyed this tutorial.</h2>
