      <h1>Lesson 9 : File Paths </h1>
      <h2> File Paths
        </h2>

        <p>A <strong>File Path</strong> is the route you dictate to the computer in order to find a file.</p>

<p>In the example on the bottom, the
  <strong> absolute path </strong>of the project.docx file is C:\Users\Al\Documents\project.docx </p>
<p>If you were working in the Al folder, you could find project.docx's <strong>relative path</strong> by telling the computer Documents\project.docx
</p>
            <p>Ex:</p>
            <p> <img src="filepaths.png" alt="Example of File Paths"></p>

            <h2>When to use absolute and relative paths
            </h2>
            <p>It is best to use absolute paths when referring to files that exist outside of your current computer.</p>
            <p>It is often best to use relative paths when you are referring to files that are on your current computer or server. This way, if the folder that contains the files is moved, the links between files does not break. Users that access the file remotely also have little problem linking the files.
            </p>
