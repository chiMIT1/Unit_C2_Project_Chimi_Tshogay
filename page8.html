      <h1>Lesson 7 : Head Elements </h1>
      <h2> Recap : the Head
        </h2>
        <p> 
            As we have learned, every web page has a head and body. The head is where the page's metadata is found, along with everything else that is meant not to appear on the visible part of the page.

            <p>Ex:</p>
            <p> <img src="headelements.png" alt="Example of Head Elements in code"></p>
          


<h2>What should go in the head?</h2>
<p>Five types of things are found in the head:

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: the title is what shows up at the top of the web page window or tab.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Metadata</strong>: data that is invisible to the viewer, but is visible to web crawlers, and thus important when the page appears in search results.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Styles</strong>: instructions to the web browser on how the web page should look.</li>
        <li><strong>Scripts</strong>: JavaScript code that must run before the body of the web page loads.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Links</strong>:  important files that are linked to the page, including external CSS and JavaScript files.

        </li>
    </ul>
