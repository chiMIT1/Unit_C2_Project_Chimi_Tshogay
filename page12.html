      <h1>Lesson 11 : Enhanced Text Editors </h1>
      <h2>Enhanced Text Editors</h2>
      <p>There are programs that help coders write code. The
         category is called <strong>enhanced text editors</strong>. These 
         are programs that aid coders in writing code by 
         doing things like highlighting tags and 
         components in different colors, auto-completing 
         or auto-formatting tags, etc.</p>

      <h2>Text editors for Windows and Mac</h2>
      <p>One of the most popular text editors for Windows is <strong>Notepad++</strong> 
        <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">(https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>For the Mac, I recommend <strong>BBEdit</strong> 
        <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/" target="_blank">(https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>For Linux, the easiest to learn is <strong>EMACS</strong> 
        <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)</a>, 
        though purists prefer <strong>vi</strong> 
        <a href="https://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">(https://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/)</a>.

      <h2>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</h2>
      <p>An <strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</strong> is a program that is designed to aid a software developer in many ways. An IDE includes a code editor, tools to test and execute the code, and tools to debug the software.</p>
      <p>Some IDEs are language-specific, others support several languages.</p>

      <h2>Online IDEs</h2>
      <p>There are several <strong>online IDEs</strong>, but most of 
         them require subscription or other payment 
         in order to enjoy adequate functionality.
      </p>
      
      <p>Two IDEs that do have some free functionality are <strong>Replit</strong>
         <a href="https://replit.com/" target="_blank">(https://replit.com/)</a> 
         and <strong>StackBlitz</strong>
         <a href="https://stackblitz.com/" target="_blank">(https://stackblitz.com/)</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Validation</h2>
      <p>There are several <strong>markup validation</strong> services 
         available on the Web. We’re going to use the W3C validation service
         <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">(https://validator.w3.org/)</a>
         because it’s hosted by W3C which is the organization that sets Web standards.
